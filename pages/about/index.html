<dl class="simple">
<dt>Here's a trip down memory lane:</dt>
<dd><ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>Pre-2009</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Interested in making video games since young, I still recall organizing some game design notes when I was around 14 years old.</p></li>
<li><p>Interested in playing video games as well, only had a few video games that I always played and enjoy.</p></li>
<li><p>Remembered making a "quiz"-like game in Microsoft Powerpoint.</p></li>
<li><p>Probably somewhere around late 2000s, I picked up a book introducing Knoppix, a LiveCD that is able to boot Linux. My first foray into Linux.</p></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>2009 - 2012</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Learned more about making games (mainly Flash, Unity) from Singapore Polytechnic.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned several frameworks like FlashPunk, Flixel and used (mainly FlashPunk) to make video games for my school projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Created several Flash games, most of which I probably cannot show now due to Flash being deprecated and most of them being part of school or internship.</p></li>
<li><p>First attempt at learning Python and Panda3D however I was not as serious at learning it at that point of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Picked up Unity's Javascript and C# for making video games.</p></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>2012 - 2014</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Learned about <a class="reference external" href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> cross-platform toolkit and it's ecosystems. Haxe is a great tool for people coming from Flash ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Tried to port a couple of my old games from FlashPunk (Flash) to HaxePunk (Haxe).</p></li>
<li><p>Also tried to developed my own <a class="reference external" href="https://gitlab.com/zhgoh/ze2d">2D framework</a> sort of thing in Haxe with OpenFL (another Haxe flash like framework)</p></li>
<li><p>Developed my own mini prototypes based on the 2D framework I developed, did not become a full game.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory is hazy on this, but I remembered joining a couple of (DBS) game jams and using Flash/Haxe/Unity.</p></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>2014 - 2018</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Decided to study CS in DigiPen. Made a couple of games in C++, those were exciting times. We have a team that build the whole game engine and tools needed to run our game.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned C, C++ (2011) in school and did all of our projects in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>Did some OpenGL assignments to draw polygons on screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Discovered Imgui library and pioneered the adoption of Imgui at my game project class by introducing tool and proof of concept in class.</p></li>
<li><p>Made 5 games in the span of 4 years in school, 3 games were with custom C++/OpenGL/DirectX engine, 1 with a OpenGL framework, 1 with a game engine provided by the school.</p></li>
<li><p>Unofficial achievement that I count is being considered one of the most engaging game that our team made in our sophomore year. We got the praise of teachers and peers alike.</p></li>
<li><p>Probably did 1/2 game jams (Unity) here as well with my University classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned about web back-end developement (Flask) and front-end (angularjs) while working to build a web tool at my first internship.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimented with a couple of static site generators, I think my first ever site was generated from Jekyll, the most popular website generator back then.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally settled into this current site with the help of Nikola static site generator. Ever since, I have updated with different looks and feels for the page.</p></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>2018 - 2019</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Working on desktop application components written in C++ as an intern. Learned more about the software development cycle and Agile.</p></li>
<li><p>Got into a bank on a technology associate program. Learned about the different process and also first time working in a web application back-end role.</p></li>
<li><p>Got some working experience in building and testing applications in Linux machines, using ssh, tmux, bash, nano, vi etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Code in my workplace are mostly written in Java. Personally not a big fan of Java because of it's verbose, however I do feel there is always a demand for Java developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere around this time, went around to picking up a new programming language, D. I was looking for something similar to C++ without the complexity of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote an FTP, Chip-8 and a Space Invader game in D as a learning exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempt (my first) Advent of code up till day 6 in D.</p></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>2020 - 2021</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Got a new job and worked on various other stuff here from work.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometime in 2020, the website 3D Buzz announced that it is closing down and I decided to write a script to parse and download all the contents of the page.</p></li>
<li><p>Interest in Vim editors brought me to using Neovim. That is one of my favorite editors I installed on almost all of my work/personal machines.</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere around this time, I got to (re)learning Java and Python so that I can tutor students in my free time.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrote a python script for one of the Shopee events to guess the correct sequence of number to redeem their voucher.</p></li>
<li><p>Interest in open source operating systems brought me to try out FreeBSD for the first time. I managed to install it and run on my personal laptops.</p></li>
<li><p>Also tried my hands on some new programming language like Julia and F#. Those are really nice language to work with.</p></li>
<li><p>Got interested in python and visualization stuff at some point and built my own analytics dashboard with Python Dash library.</p></li>
<li><p>Also attempted to install various other *BSD like NetBSD and OpenBSD to try, ultimately still stick with FreeBSD.</p></li>
<li><p>Also been interested in Emacs as well, being trying to learn it on an off. Decided to give emacs a try by using Doom Emacs, (credits to distrotube).</p></li>
<li><p>I think it was around here that I got curious about desktop tiling manager (dwm, i3, and the likes), got to try and love herbstluftwm, also tried my hands on xmonad.</p></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt>2022 - Present</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li><p>Attempt at solving Advent of code 2021 in Python</p></li>
</ul></dd>
</dl></li>
</ul></dd>

<p>I guess that's it folks!</p>
